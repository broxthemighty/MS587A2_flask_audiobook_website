Title: Atlantis Rising

Marine biologist Juno dove deep off the coast of Crete. Her sonar detected a sunken structure—too symmetrical to be natural. She and her team uncovered Atlantis, preserved by a thermal bubble.

Inside: glowing crystals, air pockets, and murals of strange sea-people. The city wasn’t just old—it was alive. When they touched the throne, a voice spoke: “You’ve awakened us.”

The ocean trembled. Atlantis began to rise—not to conquer, but to reconnect.

The tides had turned.
