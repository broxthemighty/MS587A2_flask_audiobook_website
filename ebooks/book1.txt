Title: Galactic Drift

Commander Alira soared through the nebulae in the starship *Nova Wing*. The galaxy was at peace—or so they thought. 

A strange signal echoed from an uncharted black hole. Against orders, Alira navigated toward it. 

Inside was a hidden civilization powered by a quantum crystal. The aliens welcomed her, revealing ancient knowledge.

She returned to Earth—not just a hero, but a bridge between two worlds.

The stars would never be silent again.
