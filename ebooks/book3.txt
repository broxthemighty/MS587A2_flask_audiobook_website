Title: Sands of the Pharaoh

Young archaeologist Malik uncovered a sealed chamber beneath the Sphinx. Inside, a golden journal lay beside a sarcophagus marked with Anubis' symbol. As he opened it, time twisted. He found himself in ancient Egypt.

Mistaken for a priest, he was drawn into a rebellion against a corrupt vizier. With cleverness and courage, Malik saved the pharaoh’s line.

He awoke back in the chamber—journal still in hand. History hadn’t changed... but maybe his story did.
