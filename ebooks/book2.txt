Title: The Emerald Map

Deep in the Amazon, explorer Keira stumbled upon an emerald tablet covered in vines. Locals whispered of the “Heart of the Forest”—a lost city guarded by panthers and spirits.

As Keira decoded the map, traps sprung to life, vines moved like snakes, and the jungle whispered secrets. In the end, she found the city: overgrown but majestic.

She left no treasure behind—only took a single seed. Back home, she planted it. It bloomed... and the jungle was watching.
